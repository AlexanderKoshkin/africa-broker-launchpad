            CMA Licensing in Kenya: The Complete 2025 Guide for FX & CFD Brokers
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground max-w-3xl">
            Kenya’s financial markets are emerging as one of Africa’s most dynamic destinations for FX and CFD brokers — offering a combination of regulatory clarity, strong digital adoption, and an expanding base of retail investors.
          </p>
        </header>

        <main>
          {/* Intro */}
          <section className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              The Capital Markets Authority (CMA), Kenya’s market regulator, has taken a proactive stance toward licensing and oversight. This is not a “rubber stamp” regulator: in recent years, the CMA has issued multiple cease-and-desist orders to unlicensed operators, introduced stricter reporting standards, and reinforced capital requirements. The approach signals a maturing market with credible, enforceable rules — providing licensed brokers with a clear competitive edge.
            </p>
            <p>
              The opportunity is significant yet still developing. As of early 2025, there are fewer than 20 fully licensed non-dealing online FX brokers in Kenya — a fraction compared to other global markets with similar population sizes. With over 200,000 active traders, daily FX/CFD trading volumes exceeding $50 million, and a 25% annual growth rate in retail participation, the market is attracting international interest without yet being oversaturated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kenya’s digital-first economy is another accelerant. With mobile money penetration above 96% (led by M-Pesa), brokers can integrate local payment systems for seamless deposits and withdrawals, while reaching customers via high-engagement social media channels. This combination of regulatory structure and digital accessibility makes Kenya a uniquely positioned market in 2025.
